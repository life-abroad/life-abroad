# Circle Social

A privacy-first, human-centered social platform built to strengthen real relationships and reduce harms associated with modern social media.

## Mission
Improve society’s togetherness by promoting intentional, private connections and removing attention-extracting features that encourage anxiety, isolation, and addiction.
## The problem

- Research links excessive, passive social-media use with increased depression, anxiety, and other mood issues.
- Many U.S. adults report that social media has harmed their mental health.
- Higher daily time on social platforms correlates with sleep disruption, poorer emotional regulation, and loneliness.

- Surveys show growing dissatisfaction: roughly 50% of users say they intend to significantly limit or abandon social media engagement by 2025 (Rappler).
- Average daily social-media time in 2025 is ~2h 41m, with Gen Z averaging ~3h 18m (SQ Magazine).
- Demand is rising for tools that help people restrict or escape the negative aspects of current platforms—digital‑detox and screen‑time apps are gaining traction (EssOj; TechPP).

The widespread desire to escape “doomscrolling,” algorithmic feeds, attention‑hijacking features, and social comparison signals a clear market gap. A social platform built explicitly for well‑being (friends‑only, no algorithmic feed, no predatory engagement mechanics) could attract users seeking healthier alternatives.

In short: demand‑side pull (users want something better) + supply‑side gap (existing apps aren’t designed for healthy social behaviour) = a strong market opportunity for Circle Social.

## Our approach
Design a social app that prioritizes healthy interaction and user control:

- No algorithmic feeds, reels (brainrot), or endless ads.
- No public follower counts or like metrics.
- Friends-only network: you can only communicate with people you’ve personally added.
- Simple, deliberate onboarding: add friends via invite links (text/email) or in-person phone tap.
- Group-based organization (Family, Work, Friends, etc.) to control who sees what.
- Content types focused on genuine sharing: posts, stories, groups, and private messages.
- Accessibility features like auto-translation for multilingual chats.
- Ethical monetization (cosmetic skins, sticker packs, peer payments, optional premium features) — no ad-driven compromises.

## Features
- Intentional connections: prevents strangers, bots, and predators.
- Privacy-first sharing: share publicly only by opting to generate a viewable link.
- Clear controls: group-level visibility and simple permissioning.
- Low-distraction design: no popularity mechanics or addictive reward loops.
